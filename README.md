This repo closely follow the [Udemy Course, Easy to Advanced Data Structures by William Fiset](https://www.udemy.com/introduction-to-data-structures/). The course provided the [implementations in Java](https://github.com/williamfiset/Algorithms/tree/master/src/main/java/com/williamfiset/algorithms/datastructures). To ensure that I thoroughly understood the materials, I re-implemented them in Python.
